/*
  On MSWindows platforms, one of these defines must always be set when
  building application programs:

   - "SIMVOLEON_DLL", when the application programmer is using the library
     in the form of a dynamic link library (DLL)

   - "SIMVOLEON_NOT_DLL", when the application programmer is using the
     library in the form of a static object library (LIB)

  Note that either SIMVOLEON_DLL or SIMVOLEON_NOT_DLL _must_ be
  defined by the application programmer on MSWindows platforms, or
  else the #error statement will hit. Set up one or the other of these
  two defines in your compiler environment according to how the
  library was built -- as a DLL (use "SIMVOLEON_DLL") or as a LIB (use
  "SIMVOLEON_NOT_DLL").

  (Setting up defines for the compiler is typically done by either
  adding something like "/DSIMVOLEON_DLL" to the compiler's argument
  line (for command-line build processes), or by adding the define to
  the list of preprocessor symbols in your IDE GUI (in the MSVC IDE,
  this is done from the "Project"->"Settings" menu, choose the "C/C++"
  tab, then "Preprocessor" from the dropdown box and add the
  appropriate define)).

  It is extremely important that the application programmer uses the
  correct define, as using "SIMVOLEON_NOT_DLL" when "SIMVOLEON_DLL" is
  correct will cause mysterious crashes.
